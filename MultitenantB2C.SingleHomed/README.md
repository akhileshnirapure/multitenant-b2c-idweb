# AAD Multitenancy laundered via B2C

This sample uses B2C custom policies for AAD multitenancy. In this example, the application is simplified because it only relies on a single identity provider, B2C, while B2C's configuration becomes more complex to support an additional identity provider.

There are advantages to this approach, especially for keeping application code simple.
